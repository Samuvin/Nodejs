NodeJS - JS on server 
Server ->Remote Computer CPU located at somewhere
         When we are running a website we are running it on a server 
         somebodys Computer or cloud
         At the end od the day a server is receiving a request


         Web browser makes a request
         Every website maps a domain 
         we get a IP 
         Ip points to a server or a machine
         When we are reequesting google it sends a request 
         to the server 
         When Javascript is just running on the frontend 
         There were seperate backend
         But now we can create js for frontend and backend 
         When js run on both client side and server side
         MERN Stack 
         Mongo db Express React Nodejs 
         Js can run on both client side and server side
Node js is a C++ Code 
JS engine - V8 developed by google Chromes Written in c++
JS engine - C++ program
V8 can be embedded into any c++ program
The job of V8 is to execute JS 
Js code is read By v8 and convert into Machine understandable code

NodeJs is a c++ application with V8 embedded into it 

V8 Follows EcmaSciprt standard
EcmaScipt is s standard that js follows
Ecmascript is a standard 
This EcmaSciprt is a standard that js follows and it also followed by typescript

EcmaSciprt Defines rules
Javascript works on that standard 
Standard/Rules
JS engine has to follow these Rules 
There is a committe who makes the decision
-V8              - google 
-SpiderMonkey    - FireFox 
-Chakra          - microsoft
ES6 ->6th version of the Ecmascript Standards


NodeJs is a c++ application 
V8 is inside it ->has to follow Ecmascript Standard and cannot go outside the ecmascrip standard 
Node also provide More Api above the layer of v8(modules)
V8 cannot connect to database 
V8 cannot connect to server
V8 cannot fetch Files from folder 
These are provided by Nodejs  
V8 can only run JS 
This is Known as Js runtime 
V8 is C++
Api Modules is Javascript


V8 is a c++ Code?
    Compute Understands Binary 0/1
    On top of this There is assembly language 
    On top of this there is machine Code 
    On top of this Machine Code there is High  level Lang C++ java 
    On top of this we write Js

Whenever we Write a JS code
Then it is processed by c++ code
Then it is converted by machine Code
Then it is Converted To Binary
