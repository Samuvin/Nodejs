Database is a storing data in a organised way
To fetch data put data efficiently we need to do it efficiently
In computing, a database is an organized collection of data or a type of data store 
based on the use of a database management system (DBMS), the software that interacts with end users, 
applications, and the database itself to capture and analyze the data. The DBMS additionally encompasses 
the core facilities provided to administer the database. The sum total of the database, the DBMS and the 
associated applications can be referred to as a database system. Often the term "database" is also used loosely 
to refer to any of the DBMS, the database system or an application associated with the database.
